# Portfolio1-Analysis
Analysis of data for prog data portfolio piece 1 

This project investigated the relationship between attachment style and rating relationship constructs as important (versus not important) for relationship health. 
For this class, I focus on four outcomes - Satisfaction, mutuality, core similarity, and caring. Attachment style is measured on a likert scale, and attitudes on the outcome variables are measured from -50 (makes a relationship unhealthy) to 50 (makes a relationship healthy)

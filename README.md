# Portfolio1-Analysis
Analysis of data for prog data portfolio piece 1 

This project investigated the relationship between attachment style and rating relationship constructs as important (versus not important) for relationship health. 
For this class, I focus on four outcomes - Satisfaction, mutuality, core similarity, and caring. 

There is a folder for the codebooks, in which you can find the definition of each of the outcome variables and the items that were used to measure attachment styles.
